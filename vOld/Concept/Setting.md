Its roughly 35 years into the future. There's a renewed interest in the exploitation of space. There are several small colonies in orbit of and on the surface of the moon and mars. Several more colonies are space stations floating along asteroid belts between Mars and Jupiter. Colonies function as research stations, mining stations and very exclusive tourist destinations. There are also several high-tech manufacturing processes that only work in low-gravity environments and which are thus manly conducted in orbit, or on the moon. On any given day between 200.000 and 300.000 people are not spending their day on earth. 

The exploitation of space is done by a mismatch of large corporations, under the watchful of several large (inter)-national space agencies. And up until now it has been rather peaceful. There have been several incidents, close calls, and other tense moments. When several parties tried to access the same fruitful spots. But this has not yet escalated to a situation that lead to loss of life. As fighting for resources in space does not make much sense. There's plenty of space in space and the most important resources to survive in space are found, easily accessible, on earth. 

Theoretically water, minerals and metals can all be harvested from asteroids. And there is enough of to produce space ships, food, and oxygen for millions of people. Almost every corporation has an outpost near an asteroid belt trying to put this theory into practice. But they operate on a tiny scale. They are more experimental than practical in nature. In 2055 98% of all mass used in space was imported from Earth itself.

this changed in 2056. On the 29th of February of 2056 an unexplainable catastrophe happened. It is not clear what exactly happened. But satellite imagery has not shown a living human or animal on earth since that day. Automated systems still seem to work, but without maintenance they've started to degrade. Crews from the Mars and Moon have gone down to Earth. But none have been heard from after getting closer than 40KM to the Earth's surface. And no rockets have ever come back up.

Every colony in space has contingencies to survive on their own. Some for weeks, some for months, some harder to reach stations maybe even for a year. But it was clear scarcity of resources would become a problem very soon. The first aggressions happened only a week later. 

It is now 2058. With the absence of a functioning governmental structure nobody is exactly sure about the number of surviving humans. Estimates vary greatly and range between 90.000 and 170.000. 

Asteroid belts are now the most fought over piece of space in our solar system. Especially asteroids containing rare metals as they contain the key ingredients for producing space craft, electronics, and the now very necessary weaponry.

You are in command of the forces of a medium sized corporation. You have to secure resources in the nearby asteroid belts and fend of any scavengers.
