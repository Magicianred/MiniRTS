# Game design
- Turn based tactical combat with a small fleet of space fighters in an asteroid belt
- Pseudo realistic movement (fly as rockets, not as airplanes), but no gravity
- 3D graphics but gameplay happens in a 2D plane
- Multiplayer only, no AI, no bots
- Asteroids give cover and block vision
- Goal: take out the command ship of the opponent, command ships move slowly
- No fortifications, just units, maybe a small resource gameplay loop where special resource ships hover over rare asteroids to extract minerals, they have to move back to the command ship to deposit resources
