# TODO

- The Geometry, class PostProcessTriangle class, and SkyboxGeometry class, and how their draw call looks is extremely similar
    - How to make a class that unifies this, but at the same time doesn't confuse the vertex declaration?
    - Speed :D

- I need a name for mesh data that doesn't clash with MonoGame, geometry is too broad

- Replace 'Diffuse' with 'Albedo'


- Unify geometry generation, let users pass in a vertex declaration and get the components back, or maybe just the vertex and index buffer?
