# Rules for creating rocket parts
- The origin is at the center line of the part (0, 0, 0), not at the center of mass
- Parts are exactly 4 meters tall
- Parts have a radius of exactly 1 meter (diameter of 2 meters)
- Leave parts hollow, between each part a cap will be placed
- 1 texture per part

# Rules for add-ons
- Their origin should be at the center line (0,0,0) of the rocket
- They should point in the X+ direction so the can easily be repeated


# Exporting
- Use the embedded python script inside the .blend file!
