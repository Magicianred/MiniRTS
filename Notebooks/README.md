# Notebooks

I'm experimenting with using dotnet core with Anaconda/Jupyter for interactive notebooks. Check out https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/master/docs/NotebooksLocalExperience.md for more information.

After installing Anaconda and dotnet-interactive launch Jupyter Lab by executing the command `jupyter lab` from the Anaconda shell in this directory.


(If you get WinError 5 you've probably installed anaconda for all users and thus need to run powershell as admin to be able to run these commands)
