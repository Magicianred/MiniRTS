# TODO

- The Geometry, class FullScreenTriangle class, and SkyboxGeometry class, and how their draw call looks is extremely similar
    - How to makem a class that unifies this, but at the same time doesn't confuse the vertex declaration?
    - Speed :D

- I need a name for mesh data that doesn't clash with MonoGame
